# Print Reverb with Conversion

## Escaping Special Characters in  String
Prompt the user to input their name using the following prompt exactly as shown below.

```
You're Jane's friend!
"What's your name?"
Jean Claude
```
 
**NOTE:**  *The input, such as "Jean Claude," should not appear in your output when executed in this Skill Builder.  It is provided to simulate how your output would actually look if your program executed from the terminal or command line.*

## Getting Floating Point Input
Prompt the user to input a floating-point number and assign it to a variable called `spice`.  

```
You're Jane's friend!
"What's your name?"
Jean Claude

Enter a floating-point number:
2.34
```

## Mathematical Expressions
Calculate the mathematical expression ![eq1](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?\frac{4}{3}2^{\big(\frac{\sqrt{5}}{spice^3}\big)}) and output the result so that the output looks like:


```
You're Jane's friend!
"What's your name?"
Jean Claude

Enter a floating-point number:
2.34

Well Jean Claude, the spice value resulted in 1.5047818732113996
```
You should use an assignment statement to store the value of the expression.

**Please Note:** The expression ![eq1](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?\frac{4}{3}2^{\big(\frac{\sqrt{5}}{spice^3}\big)}) has the number 2 raised 
to the power of the value calculated from the expression ![eq2](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?\big(\frac{\sqrt{5}}{spice^3}\big)).

## Converting to Integer

convert the value of the expression,
![eq1](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?\frac{4}{3}2^{\big(\frac{\sqrt{5}}{spice^3}\big)})

for which you calculated previously to the nearest hundredth place so that the output looks as follows:

```
You're Jane's friend!
"What's your name?"
Jean Claude

Enter a floating-point number:
2.34

Well Jean Claude, the spice value resulted in 1.5047818732113996
And the converted value is 1.50
